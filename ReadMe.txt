My game is themed after Minecraft, a game I have played for nearly 15 years. The player, controlling Steve, must avoid the zombies and collect the diamonds in order to win the game.

Diamonds and zombies work as regular collects and avoids. Zombies are set to spawn more often while diamonds are more rare.

TNT is now the special collect. TNT has to be clicked on with the mouse to collect. When collected, the TNT explodes, destroying everything currently on screen. TNT restores 1 HP and adds 5 points to the score.

Slime blocks are now the special avoid. Slime blocks act similarly to the original special avoid in that it removes 50 points from the score and decreases the HP by 1. However, when the player collides with a slime block, it “bounces” the player to the left side of the screen.

The win and loss conditions are the same. If HP reaches 0, the player loses. If the score reaches 300, the player wins. A respective end screen is displayed.
